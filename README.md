# 📁 **JavaScript Design Patterns**

This repository contains simple and practical JavaScript examples of **common software design patterns**, grouped into three main categories:

* ✅ **Creational Patterns** (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Builder, Prototype)
* 🧱 **Structural Patterns** (e.g., Adapter, Decorator, Proxy)
* 🧠 **Behavioral Patterns** (e.g., Observer, Strategy, Command)

Each example is written in **modern JavaScript (ES6+)**, with clear and concise code to help you understand how these patterns work in the real world.
